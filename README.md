# PsychoPy Starter Kit
Use the files here to start writing an experiment with Psychopy!

#### `example_experiment.py`, `config.py` and `example_img/`
These are files for an example experiment, which shows two images in a trial and asks the participant to choose one. `example_experiment.py` contains code for the experiment flow, `config.py` contains the constants (numbers and strings) needed in the experiment, and `example_img/` contains the images. You can start with removing/replacing the images, and adapting `example_experiment.py` and `config.py` to fit the needs of your experiment. 

#### `psychopy_util.py`
This file contains helper classes and functions that aim to make writing PsychoPy experiments easier. You can read the docstrings/comments about the classes and functions to see if they can be useful in your experiment.

#### `dumb_text_input.py`
This file contains a helper classes that makes it possible for participants to enter texts during a PsychoPy experiment, but in a slightly silly way (i.e. refreshing the window every time a key is pressed). See the docstring at the beginning of that file for usage.
